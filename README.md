# Face Recognition Web App with Machine Learning & Flask
Face recognition is one of the most widely used technologies in modern applications. I have learned that to develop and deploy such an application on the web, knowing only machine learning or deep learning is not sufficient. It is also important to understand how to build a pipeline architecture, handle HTTP requests from the client-side, and manage several other components. During the development process, one can encounter various real-world challenges. This project has helped me learn how to build a face recognition-based web app completely from scratch.
### Final Ouptut of the project

After completion of the course you will develop as shown in URL: <https://genderrecognition-flask.herokuapp.com/>

What you will learned?

1. Python
2. Image Processing with OpenCV
3. Image Data Preprocessing
4. Image Data Analysis
5. Eigenfaces with PCA
6. Face Recognition Classification Model with Support Vector Machines
7. Pipeline Model
8. Flask (Jinja Template, HTML, CSS, HTTP Methods)

Finally, Face recognition Web App

I have learned various image processing techniques using OpenCV and gained a clear understanding of the concepts behind digital images. I also explored essential image analysis methods and applied the required preprocessing steps to prepare images for further tasks.

I have learned how to preprocess images by extracting features through techniques like computing Eigen images using Principal Component Analysis. Using these Eigen images, I trained a machine learning model and tested it before deployment. To ensure optimal performance, I tuned the model using the Grid Search method to find the best hyperparameters..

I have learned to develop a Web Server Gateway Interface using Flask by rendering HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for the frontend, with Python handling the backend. Finally, I built the complete Face Recognition project by integrating the trained machine learning model into the Flask application.
